# Vacuum robot simulator

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

A simulation environment for an autonomous robot that should (eventually) be
able to localize itself within and navigate through its (virtual) environment.

## Assumptions

- Two-dimensional world
- Static environment
- **Sensor:** 360Â° laser scanner - with simulated measurement noise
- **Control:** rotate_by(*angle*), drive_forward(*distance*) - with simulated imprecision

## Software architecture (planned)
